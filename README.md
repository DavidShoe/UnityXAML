The sample is composed of two parts, the XAML portion and the unity portion with a communication class used to pass information between them.

When you start the application you should get a split screen view.

#### The upper portion is controlled by the mainpage.xaml and contain:
* Two buttons
* A text block
* And a web view
#### The lower is the unity scene, which contains:
* One button 
* And a view used to show results.

Pressing "Web Navigate XAML" cause the XAML web view to navigate to a web page.
Pressing "Send To Unity (XAML)" will cause the feedback view to show a new message.
Pressing "SendDataToXAML (UB)" will cause a message to be sent to the xaml portion showing a count of events from Unity.
